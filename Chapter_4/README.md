## Chapter code excerpts
The code snippets from the chapter can be found in the order of appearance in the `chapter_code_excerpts` folder. Examples: `00_error_class.py`  
These are provided for reference and are not meant to be runnable.

At this point, the task management application is not yet implemented to a level that can be run. But the folder structure and files are present for you to explore (`TodoApp` folder).
