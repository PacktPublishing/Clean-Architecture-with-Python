# Chapter 5

The code exampes from the chapter can be found in the order of appearance in the files with numeric indexes (ex:
`00_error_class.py`)


## Companion task management application

At this point, the TodoApp is not yet implemented to a level that can be run. But the folder structure and files are present for you to explore (`TodoApp` folder).

There is a suite of unit tests which you can run to verify the code is working as expected.

Ensure you have followed the instructions in the [Getting started](../README.md#2-getting-started) section to set up your environment.

```shell
> cd TodoApp
> pytest
```
