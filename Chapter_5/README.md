## Companion task management application

At this point, the TodoApp is not yet implemented to a level that can be run. But the folder structure and files are present for you to explore (`TodoApp` folder).

There is a suite of unit tests which you can run to verify the code is working as expected.

Ensure you have followed the instructions in the repository's [README](../README.md) section to set up your environment.

```shell
> cd TodoApp
> pytest
```
