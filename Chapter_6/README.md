# Chapter 6

The code from the chapter can be found in the order of appearance in the files with numeric indexes (ex:
`00_error_class.py`)

## Companion task management application

At this point, the TodoApp is not yet implemented to a level that can be run. But the folder structure and files are present for you to explore (`TodoApp` folder).

There is a suite of unit tests which you can run to verify the code is working as expected.

Ensure you have followed the instructions in the [Getting started](../README.md#2-getting-started) section to set up your environment.

```shell
> cd TodoApp
> pytest
```

**Note:** You will see a `infrastructure` folder also.  This is not part of the chapter 6 content, only there to support the development of the interfaces code.  The full development of the infrastructure code, (Framework/Drivers layer), is covered in chapter 7.
