# Chapter 6

The code from the chapter can be found in the order of appearance in the files with numeric indexes (ex:
`00_error_class.py`)

## Companion task management application

In addition to that the evolving personal todo app files aligned with the chapter content can be found in the `ToDoApp`
folder.

**Note:** You will see a `infrastructure` folder also.  This is not part of the chapter 6 content, only there to support the development of the interfaces code.  The full development of the infrastructure code, (Framework/Drivers layer), is covered in chapter 7.
