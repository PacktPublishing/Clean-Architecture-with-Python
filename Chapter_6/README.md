# Chapter 6

## Chapter code excerpts
The code snippets from the chapter can be found in the order of appearance in the `chapter_code_excerpts` folder. Examples: `00_error_class.py`  
These are provided for reference and are not meant to be runnable.

## Companion task management application

At this point, the TodoApp is not yet implemented to a level that can be run. But the folder structure and files are present for you to explore (`TodoApp` folder).

There is a suite of unit tests which you can run to verify the code is working as expected.

Ensure you have followed the instructions in the repository's [README](../README.md) section to set up your environment.

```shell
> cd TodoApp
> pytest
```

**Note:** You will see a `infrastructure` folder also.  This is not part of the chapter 6 content, only there to support the development of the interfaces code.  The full development of the infrastructure code, (Framework/Drivers layer), is covered in chapter 7.
